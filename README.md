# The form of the danger is an emanation of energy.
This project was created in 3 days for a game jam, where the theme was inspired by [long-term nuclear waste wrning messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_nuclear_waste_warning_messages)

## Live Demo
You can play the Live Demo on itch.io [here](https://sedson.itch.io/form-of-danger).
Note: Live Demo may not work correctly in Chrome

## To Run Locally
Run `python3 -m http.server` from the project root. Should see a lime green canvas!

If you have a problem with the port already running, it's probably port 8000 - run `kill 8000` to stop it.
